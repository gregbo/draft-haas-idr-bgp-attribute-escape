                          BGP Attribute Escape
                 draft-haas-idr-bgp-attribute-escape-00

Abstract

   BGP-4 [RFC 4271] has been very successful in being extended over the
   years it has been deployed.  A significant part of that success is
   due to its ability to incrementally add new features to its Path
   Attributes when they are marked "optional transitive".
   Implementations that are ignorant of a feature for an unknown Path
   Attribute that are so marked will propagate BGP routes with such
   attributes.

   Unfortunately, this blind propagation of unknown Path Attributes may
   happen for features that are intended to be used in a limited scope.
   When such Path Attributes inadvertantly are carried beyond that
   scope, it can lead to things such as unintended disclosure of
   sensitive information, or cause improper routing.  In their worst
   cases, such propagation may be for malformed Path Attributes and lead
   to BGP session resets or crashes.

   This document calls such inadvertent propagation of BGP Path
   Attributes, "attribute escape".  This document further describes some
   of the scenarios that leads to this behavior and makes
   recommendations on practices that may limit its impact.

Internet-Draft            BGP Attribute Escape                 July 2023


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  BGP Path Attributes and Transitivity

   BGP-4 [RFC4271] carries routing information in UPDATE messages.  BGP
   UPDATEs pair set of network layer reachability information (NLRI),
   i.e. destinations, with properties for those destinations.  Those
   properties are carried in Path Attributes (Section 4.3 of [RFC4271]).
   The BGP-4 RFC defines a base set of Path Attributes, several of which
   are "mandatory", and two that are optional.

   Optional Path Attributes are flagged to be either "transitive" or
   "non-transitive".  This flag controls how a BGP implementation that
   does not recognize a Path Attribute will handle them.  In particular,
   unrecognized non-transitive Path Attributes, "MUST be quietly ignored
   and not passed along to other BGP peers".  However, if the attribute
   is non-transitive but recognized, the procedures documented for that
   feature will control how it is propagated by such an implementation.

   Emphasizing this point: Non-transitive Path Attributes are only
   guaranteed to be dropped during BGP route propagation by
   implementations that do not recognize them.

   Unrecognized transitive Path Attributes, if they are accepted by the
   implementation (and they usually are), will be propagated.  However,
   when they are unrecognized, the "Partial" flag is set indicating that
   at least one BGP speaker in the propagation path did not recognize
   the feature.  In practice, this flag is solely informational and not
   used by implementations to change their processing of the attribute
   when they recognize it.

3.  Motivation to Make New Path Attributes Transitive, and When It's Not
    Safe

   Authors of new BGP features often desire to make their new Path
   Attributes to be transitive in order to avoid having to upgrade BGP
   speakers in their networks to support the new feature.  A particular
   case where this is desired is to avoid upgrading BGP route reflectors
   [RFC4456].  When it's the case that a feature only needs to be
   supported by a partial set of BGP speakers in the network, this often
   works well.

Internet-Draft            BGP Attribute Escape                 July 2023


   A particular case where this strategy fails is when the feature
   alters BGP's Decision Process (Section 9.1 of [RFC4271]); i.e. route
   selection.  In general, it is necessary for all BGP speakers in an
   Autonomous System (AS) to agree on how to do route selection.
   Inconsistent route selection may lead to routing or forwarding loops.

   A consequence of this point is that any new feature that alters route
   selection needs to be consistently deployed within an AS.  In most
   circumstances, this is true for the full scope of BGP route
   propagation where the next hop is unchanged.  Thus, this applies to
   BGP Confederations [RFC5065] as well.

   Non-transitive Path Attributes can be helpful for features that
   impact route selection.  A consequence of their behavior is that once
   a route containing a non-transitive Path Attribute reaches a BGP
   speaker that is ignorant of its behavior, that attribute will be
   dropped.  An example of this behavior is used in the AIGP [RFC7311]
   feature.

4.  Attribute Escape

4.1.  Attribute Scoping

   Propagation scope is typically described as part of a BGP protocol
   extension's procedure.  A common scoping boundary is intra-AS only;
   for example, drop at eBGP boundaries.  BGP Capabilities [RFC5492] can
   also provide the ability to signal a scoping boundary.  Another
   implicit scoping boundary are features that are AFI/SAFI specific
   ([RFC4760]); the scope is the contiguous domain of all devices that
   participate in that AFI/SAFI.

   Non-transitive Path Attributes cannot be propagated outside of the
   scope of the set of BGP speakers that understand them.  If such a
   Path Attribute is advertised "too far", it's a failure of the scoping
   mechanisms for that feature.

   Transitive Path Attributes may similarly take advantage of the
   scoping mechanisms defined above, but only by devices that understand
   those Path Attributes.

4.2.  Escape

   Any circumstance where a BGP Path Attribute attached to a route
   manages to be propagated outside of its intended scope is an
   "escape".

Internet-Draft            BGP Attribute Escape                 July 2023


   A first example of escape are Path Attributes for new features that
   are intended to be dropped at eBGP boundaries.  That is, the feature
   intra-AS only.  An example of such expected filtering is the BGP
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute (TEA) (Section 11 of [RFC9012]).  BGP
   speakers implementing this feature are expected to remove the TEA
   when sending routes to eBGP speakers by default.  However, if a BGP
   speaker that is an eBGP router doesn't understand the TEA, it can't
   do this filtering.  Similarly, the procedures recommend that at an
   eBGP boundary that received routes remove the TEA by default.  In
   such cases, if the eBGP speaker doesn't understand the TEA, it won't
   be removed there either.  When both failures happen, and if it's the
   case that an AS receives from another AS routes with the TEA, it may
   inadvertently use that TEA within their network.

   A second example of escape is when attributes are expected to change
   at next hop reset boundaries.  While this is typically the case at
   eBGP boundaries, this could be elsewhere within a network by
   configuration.  One example of this is the BGP Entropy Label feature
   [RFC6790].  A second example is the BGP Prefix-SID feature [RFC8669].

   A third example of escape is when attributes leak across AFI/SAFIs.
   Layer-3 VPNs [RFC4364] operate by distributing routes learned from
   customer networks as IPv4 Unicast routes through a provider backbone
   using a different AFI/SAFI.  Features that are used within the
   provider network, and attributes attached to those routes that are
   solely for use within the scope of the provider network and not
   intended for the customer network, need to be filtered when the route
   is again placed in a customer network context.  However, it's often
   the case that filtering is not carefully done when leaking the routes
   back into the customer network (VRF).  Unrecognized Path Attributes
   may be copied wholly.  An example of such a provider-network-only
   feature is the ATTR_SET [RFC6368].

4.3.  Community Escapes

   BGP Communities of various forms ([RFC1997], [RFC4360], [RFC8092])
   are often arbitrary operator-supplied route markup intended to have
   local or closely coordinated significance.  RFC 1997 communities
   provide for a small set of well-known communities that have impact on
   BGP route scoping, and are reasonably well-respected among various
   implementations.  RFC 1997 and RFC 8092 Large BGP communities often
   are distributed further than necessary and in most circumstances
   simply contribute to "operational clutter".

   However, some communities that are partially standardized but don't
   have consistent global significance may also impact traffic.  An
   example of this is the BGP Blackhole Community [RFC7999].

Internet-Draft            BGP Attribute Escape                 July 2023


   The majority of RFC 4360 BGP Extended Communities in use tend to be
   for features related to VPN-feature signaling.  Extended Communities
   have their own internal transitivity scoping, which is intened to be
   enforced at AS boundaries.  However, such enforcement can only be
   implemented by BGP speakers that understand Extended Communities.

   In general, while BGP community features are well-deployed and well
   understood, they may have similar escape issues.  Section 11 of
   [RFC7454] offers some guidance on locally scrubbing such things.

4.4.  Inadvertent Use

   One of the main, and typically accidental impacts of attribute escape
   are BGP speakers that have received such escaped attributes and make
   use of them.  In some cases, these are features that require explicit
   configuration to use.  In many cases, BGP implementations will simply
   process received attributes and make use of them without additional
   configuration.

   Such inadvertent use can have unexpected impacts on a network.  This
   can be unexpected route selection, or mis-routed traffic.  Another
   case may be traffic that blackholes.

   Such behaviors may be maliciously exploited.

4.5.  Outages Cause by Attribute Escape

   While transitive Path Attributes have proved that BGP's extension
   mechanisms has done well over the years, they've also provided the
   vehicle for network incidents and outages.  A particular form of this
   is when an implementation of a partially deployed feature receives a
   malformed transitive Path Attribute from a BGP speaker that didn't
   understand that attribute.  The author has previously termed this
   problem, "optional transitive nonsense".

   The underlying issue for such nonsense is the response of the
   receiving BGP speaker.  Using core RFC 4271 procedures, such a
   malformed Path Attribute is reason to reset the BGP session.
   (Section 6.3 of [RFC4271]) However, since the BGP neighbor that
   propagated the route may not have been the originator of that
   attribute, this penalizes the BGP neighbor.

   In far more unfortunate circumstances such malformed attributes may
   exercise defects in the BGP stack and cause crashes.  These crashes
   impacts the entire BGP speaker rather than individual sessions.  Such
   issues may be maliciously exploited.

   These issues were motivations for the "Revised Error Handling for BGP
   UPDATE Messages" document, [RFC7606].

5.  Mitigating Attribute Escape

5.1.  Explicit Permit Lists, and Their Dangers

   One strategy to mitigate these sort of issues can be explicit permit
   lists.  Rather than simply propagate all unknown Path Attributes,
   lists of permitted Path Attributes by Attribute Type Code may be
   propagated through the network.  However, this methodology has two
   strong negative impacts:

   Similar to running any other large permit list infrastructure, as is
   often seen in large network firewall deployments, maintaining the
   lists themselves can be immensely burdensome at an operational level.
   Once a policy has been devised for the deployment, it must be
   consistent deployed to have good effect.

   Additionally, this methodology is an "attack" on the feature that has
   provided for BGP's successful incremental deployment of new features.
   This struggle is a common one for users in firewalled networks where
   attempts to use new features are thwarted by the operators.  However,
   in this case, this can impact deployment of desirable new features
   for the Internet.  Consider, for example, [RFC9234] which is intended
   to provide additional protection vs. BGP route leaking.  Aggressive
   filtering may prevent such new features from being deployed.

   Aggressive filtering may be more reasonable in some contexts.  For
   example, a Layer-3 VPN customer may benefit from aggressive default
   Path Attribute filtering as it provides protection from attribute
   escape from their provider.  However, in cases where newer BGP
   features are desired to be carried across the VPN, additional
   coordination with their service provider may be required.

5.2.  Stronger Implementation Filtering Mechanisms

   IETF review practices have evolved to start discussing attribute
   escape and its impacts.  This review may lead to text recommending
   where filtering should be done and how.  (See again the example for
   the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute, Section 11 of [RFC9012].)  It is
   important that implementors and vendors translate these filtering
   requirements as easy to configure mechanisms for enforcement.








Haas                     Expires 10 January 2024                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            BGP Attribute Escape                 July 2023


   Current IETF practice is to include an Operational Considerations
   ([RFC5706]) section in its documents.  Such considerations are a hint
   (or requirement!) to implementors to create mechanisms that permit
   for safe management for features.  This is especially true during
   incremental or partial deployment of new features.

5.3.  Scoping by Protocol Feature

   Similar to the accepted truism that IETF considered security after
   the fact in its protocols, most older BGP features have not
   considered what to do about attribute escape.  Understanding now that
   these are issues impacting incremental deployment of new features and
   their operations, it's possible to consider including scoping
   directly in new extensions.

5.3.1.  AS Scoping

   Many BGP features are intended to be scoped to one or more ASes.  As
   described above, such mechanisms can't rely on all devices in an AS
   to have implemented a feature that's built using transitive Path
   Attributes.

   New features that are intended to be AS-Scoped SHOULD consider
   including an scoping AS number, or AS number list, as part of the
   attribute.  BGP speakers that use such features should have as part
   of their configuration a list of non-local ASes that they may wish to
   trust for utilizing such new features.  This can permit a single
   "scope AS" to be included in the feature with a set of coopertaing
   providers using different ASes able to such routes.

   Implementations of such AS-Scoped features SHOULD have mechanism that
   permit filtering of the feature's Path Attributes at AS boundaries.
   While the scoping-AS described above can help avoid issues with
   inadvertent usage, it can't help vs. actual malicious exploit where
   the scoping-AS is spoofed.

   The BGP Wide Communities feature
   ([I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities]) includes such an AS-Scoping
   mechanism.

5.3.2.  Next Hop Scoping

   Some BGP features rely on their semantics based on when the next hop
   of the route has been changed.  In circumstances where the feature is
   only correct at such boundaries, embedding the "last set nexthop" can
   be used to detect when a Path Attribute has propagated past a device
   that has reset the next hop without the associated change to the
   feature.

Internet-Draft            BGP Attribute Escape                 July 2023


   New features that are intended to next hop scope SHOULD consider
   including the next hop that was last present when the feature is
   being used.

   An example of this methodology is the BGP Router Capabilities
   Attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-entropy-label].

5.3.3.  Changes to the BGP protocol

   More general changes to the BGP protocol could be considered to try
   to standardize some of these behaviors.  One such approach has been
   documented, but not deployed in "Constrain Attribute announcement
   within BGP" [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-attribute-announcement].

   Similar approaches to this, or more protocol generalized forms of the
   other advice above, might be beneficial inputs if the core BGP
   specification is ever revised.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document highlights properties of the BGP protocol and
   situations where its defined behavior for propagating Path Attributes
   may lead to inadvertent disclosure of information, improper routing,
   or even session resets and crashes.  Such behaviors can be
   maliciously exploited.
